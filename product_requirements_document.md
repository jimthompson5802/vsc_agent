# Product Requirements Document

A flask application that allows a user to enter text into a text box and the application will echo back the text in a different text box with the string "echoed: " in front of it. The application should also have a button that, when clicked, will clear both text boxes.

## Requirements
1. **User Interface**
   - The application should have a simple and clean user interface.
   - There should be two text boxes:
     - The first text box for user input.
     - The second text box for displaying the echoed text.
   - There should be a button to clear both text boxes.
   - The button should be labeled "Clear".
   - The button should be positioned below the text boxes.
   - The text boxes should be large enough to accommodate a reasonable amount of text.
   
2. **Functionality**
   - When the user enters text into the first text box and clicks the button, the application should display the text in the second text box prefixed with "echoed: " followed by the text entered in the first text box.
   - The application should handle empty input gracefully, displaying "echoed: " without any additional text.
   - When the user clicks the "Clear" button, both text boxes should be cleared.
